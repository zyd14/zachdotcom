I'm currently a software engineer by trade.  In my free time I love to run. 
Alongside spending time with loved ones, it's probably the thing I like to do 
the most. I also really enjoy hiking, camping, biking, gardening, basically anything
outdoors. When stuck inside (or recovering from being outside) I love reading books (particularly Sci-fi),
learning about and practicing software engineering, and cooking.    

### Work experience  
I've been working at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA
since the spring of 2016, helping scientists deliver data and analyses for studies on life-threatening illnesses. 
In my current role I am on a small team where I wear many hats. I do most-things backend; serverless REST API development, 
database design and administration, cloud architecture, CI/CD and more.  There are always new challenges as our application
develops, all an opportunity to learn a new skill set. My latest endeavor has been taking on the security 
aspect of our application.  

### Specific Skills  
Languages:  
  
- Strong: Python, SQL (Postgres)
- Proficient: Java  

Tools:  

* AWS 
    * API Gateway, Lambda, Batch, S3, EC2, ECS, SQS, SNS, RDS, IAM, Cloudwatch  
* Docker, Circle CI  
* Flask, Zappa  

Other:  

* HIPPA compilance familiarity  
* Bioinformatics background

### Software Engineering
I've been heavily exposed to cloud applications in my current role, and particularly enjoy how available 
it makes a lot of tools to the average developer or small team. The complexity and functionality of some of the managed
tool getting put out there by the various cloud providers is pretty damn impressive, and they just keep improving.  

I have always enjoyed the architecture and design pattern aspect of software engineering, and find myself digesting a lot of information on 
the topic in any form I can - books, articles, and podcasts. With more exposure to cloud computing I've become very 
interested in distributed messaging / event-driven architectures. I enjoy helping others with technical problems when I can,
and love that I can usually find help from someone when I need it.  
In the past few years I've been chasing object-oriented patterns with a more functionally-oriented implementation.  Meaning
I've been finding myself exploring patterns where I generally separate classes of objects into data and operators. The data
classes hold the state of the information needing to be operated on, while the operators hold the logic needed to operate 
on the data.  This allows for mostly static and class-level methods on the operator classes, making them much easier to 
test, while leaving most if not all logic out of the data classes.  It also greatly simplifies the input validation and
object creation components.  

I believe in automated deployments, and deploying on Fridays. If you aren't comfortable enough to deploy on a Friday you 
need to fix your deployment process.
