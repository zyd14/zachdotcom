### What's this all about?
I created this website is to explore how to use tools related to web hosting and get a better 
overall handle on the different components used to run a website.  I've been working in
backend software / data engineering for a little over 4 years, and felt 
that gaining more knowledge on how front end applications serve their content,
as well as about the infrastructure that supports them, would help me design 
better backend systems in the long run.  Front end development has always been
a bit of a fear of mine, particularly since I really don't know much about it. 
But the only way to get better at something is to fail and flail first, so here's flailing!  

### Technologies used currently
I've chosen to go easy on myself to start with by using a language I feel pretty strong in (Python) 
and a framework I'm proficient in (Flask). Eventually I'd like to start using Javascript on the page,
but for now I'm just trying to get some content generated and routes up. I'm currently using Bootstrap 
for styling.

### Things to try out
As I said earlier, this is mostly for me to explore new technologies and try to strengthen up 
my weak spots that I don't get to use much at work. One goal of this project is to get a much 
better understanding of how Javascript interacts with the page, and more generally how to use it. 
I'd really like to eventually learn TypeScript of some form or another, but I think just getting 
some foundational js first would go a long way.  
Another area I'm a bit weak in is the actual hosting of the webapp itself.  I'd like to explore 
various ways of actually running and hosting the webapp. Currently I'm working on having the 
application deployable via Docker, so I will easily be able to switch between deployment in the cloud
vs. self hosted vs. with another provider. It would be an interesting exercise to try out different 
cloud providers' different ways of hosting containers.  
I'd love to find an excuse to set up a MongoDB database to back some part of the application. I've 
done a fair amount of SQL at this point and would like an opportunity to explore NoSQL design and use
more. It would also help me understand a bit more through example how to connect services that are 
in different containers together.
